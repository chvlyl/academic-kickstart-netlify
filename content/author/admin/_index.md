I’m a data scientist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. My work involves analyzing patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, image data, clinical text data as well as hospital operational data using advanced machine learning and statistical methods to improve the healthcare in the hospital. I’m particularly interested in deep learning, natural language processing and image analysis. I have successfully applied those techniques to the EHR data, surgery note text data and eye image data and solved real-world problems. I received my Ph.D. from University of Pennsylvania. My PhD research mainly focused on statistical methods for metagenomic data anlaysis. 

I’m also interested in financial investments and passed the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) Level 1 exam.
