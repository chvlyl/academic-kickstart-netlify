I'm a Senior Expert Research Scientist at UII America. I previously worked as data scientists at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. My work involves devleloping deep learning modesls for Electronic Health Records (EHR), medical images, clinical text as well as hospital operational data. I received my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from University of Pennsylvania. I have over 50 publications with over 5000 citations.  

Iâ€™m also interested in financial investments and passed the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) Level 1 exam.
